Both high-level and detailed descriptions of DVID and its ecosystem can found here:

* A high-level description of [Data Management in Connectomics](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flyem/blog/data-management-in-connectomics) that includes DVID's use in the [Janelia FlyEM Team](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flyem).
* [Paper on DVID](https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncir.2019.00005)
describing its motivation and architecture, including how versioning works at the key-value
level.  
* The [Neutu Documentation Site](https://janelia-flyem.gitbook.io/neutu) describes our team's main proofreading tool and how it uses DVID as a dataservice.
* The [DVID Wiki](https://github.com/janelia-flyem/dvid/wiki) is a more complete but older user guide that will be updated on this website.  If you find a topic missing here, it's possible  the old DVID Wiki has information on the topic.
